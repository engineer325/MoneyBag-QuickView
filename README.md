This repository show some brief information about the my project - MoneyBag(NFTs) Generator.

First, I am sorry - As you can guess, this project is private one. That's why I can not share whole project source here. Here, I just share some brief infomation about project.

A money bag is composed of four parts, that is,

- Background
- Bag
- Symbol
- Accessory

The first three parts are always required
and the last one optional.
